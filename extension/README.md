# What?

`pWebArc` (Private Web Archive): a browser extension that passively collects and archives dumps of HTTP requests and responses to your own private archiving server (like [the dumb archiving server](../dumb_server/)) as you browse the web.

This is similar to ScrapBook add-ons like [WebScrapBook](https://github.com/danny0838/webscrapbook), but following "archive everything now, figure out what to do with it later" philosophy instead of manually archiving things one-by-one. Also similar to [archiveweb.page](https://github.com/webrecorder/archiveweb.page), but with less user interaction.

Basically, you install this, enable it, run the archiving server, and forget about it until you need to refer back to something you've seen before.

# Installation

See [Quickstart](../README.md#quickstart).

# What does it do exactly? I have questions.

See [extension's "Help" page](./page/help.org) and the FAQ there. If your question is unanswered by it, then open an Issue on GitHub.
