<code>Hoardy-Web</code> is a browser extension (add-on) that passively captures and collects dumps of <code>HTTP</code> requests and responses as you browse the web, and then archives them using one or more of the following methods:

<ul>
<li>by saving them into your browser’s local storage, which is the default;</li>
<li>by submitting them to your own private archiving server via <code>HTTP</code>, like
<ul>
<li>the simple archiving-only server <a href="https://oxij.org/software/hoardy-web/tree/master/simple_server/"><code>hoardy-web-sas</code></a> (also on <a href="https://github.com/Own-Data-Privateer/hoardy-web/tree/master/simple_server/">GitHub</a>) or</li>
<li>the advanced archival+replay server <a href="https://oxij.org/software/hoardy-web/tree/master/tool/"><code>hoardy-web serve</code></a> (also on <a href="https://github.com/Own-Data-Privateer/hoardy-web/tree/master/tool/">GitHub</a>);</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>by generating fake-Downloads containing bundles of those dumps, making your browser simply save them to your <code>Downloads</code> directory.</li>
</ul>

<code>Hoardy-Web</code> produces dumps in a very simple, yet efficient, <a href="https://oxij.org/software/hoardy-web/tree/master/doc/data-on-disk.md"><code>WRR</code> file format</a> (also on <a href="https://github.com/Own-Data-Privateer/hoardy-web/tree/master/doc/data-on-disk.md">GitHub</a>).

Also, <code>Hoardy-Web</code> implements:

<ul>
<li>capture of <code>DOM</code> snapshots;</li>
<li>various indicators that help in ensuring good and complete website captures,</li>
<li>inspection of captured <code>HTTP</code> traffic, similar to browser’s own <code>Network Monitor</code> (except browser-wise, i.e., it can capture <code>HTTP</code> requests even when a page generates them when its tab/window closes; which a surprising number of websites does to prevent their web traffic from being inspected with <code>Network Monitor</code>);</li>
<li>some post-capture machinery that helps in archiving only select subsets of captured data;</li>
<li>archival+replay integration when used in combination with an advanced archiving+replay server like <code>hoardy-web serve</code>;</li>
<li>some more generally useful web browsing features (like per-tab <code>Work offline</code> mode);</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

In other words, this extension implements an in-browser half of your own personal private passive <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> that archives everything you see, including <code>HTTP POST</code> requests and responses (e.g. answer pages of web search engines), as well as most other <code>HTTP</code>-level data (<code>AJAX</code>, <code>JSON RPC</code>, etc).

Also, the extension can be used independently of other related tools, so you can install it and start saving your browsing history immediately, and then delay learning to use the rest for later.

To view and replay your archived data you will need to install at least the <a href="https://oxij.org/software/hoardy-web/tree/master/tool/">accompanying <code>hoardy-web</code> tool</a> (also on <a href="https://github.com/Own-Data-Privateer/hoardy-web/tree/master/tool/">GitHub</a>) which can

<ul>
<li>replay your archives over <code>HTTP</code> (a-la a local <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a>),</li>
<li>generate static website mirrors from them (a-la <code>wget -mpk</code>),</li>
<li>search, inspect, organize, manipulate, programmatically extract values from, and run scripts over your collected data.</li>
</ul>

With <code>Hoardy-Web</code>, capture, archival, and replay are all independent from each other. But <code>Hoardy-Web</code> browser extension implements optional integration of passive browsing data capture with archival to and the following replay from a <code>hoardy-web serve</code> instance.

<strong>Therefore, on a modern browser, using both the <code>Hoardy-Web</code> browser extension and the <code>hoardy-web</code> tool simultaneously allows you to keep an arbitrary number of open tabs, allow your browser to unload them at will, and then switch to them later without re-fetching anything from the Internet, as if you had infinite amounts of RAM and never closed your browser or rebooted your computer.</strong>

The <a href="https://oxij.org/software/hoardy-web/#screenshots">“Storyboarded screenshots” section</a> (also on <a href="https://github.com/Own-Data-Privateer/hoardy-web#screenshots">GitHub</a>) explains the above with pictures.

Note that:

<ul>
<li><code>Hoardy-Web</code> <strong>DOES NOT</strong> send any of your captured web browsing data anywhere, unless you explicitly configure it to do so.</li>
<li><code>Hoardy-Web</code> <strong>DOES NOT</strong> send any telemetry anywhere.</li>
<li>Both of the above statements will apply to <strong>all future versions</strong> of <code>Hoardy-Web</code>.</li>
</ul>

The former page also contains in-depth comparisons to <code>DownloadNet</code>, <code>mitmproxy</code>, <code>archiveweb.page</code>, and other similar and related software.

<code>Hoardy-Web</code> was previously known as “Personal Private Passive Web Archive” aka <code>pWebArc</code>.
