<a href="https://github.com/Own-Data-Privateer/hoardy-web"><b>Hoardy-Web</b></a> (also <a href="https://oxij.org/software/hoardy-web/">there</a>) helps you to passively capture, archive, and hoard your web browsing history.
Not just the URLs, but also the contents and the resources (images, media, CSS, etc) of the pages you visit.
Not just the last 3 months, but from the beginning of time you start using it.

Or, in short, you install this and just browse the web normally while <b>Hoardy-Web</b> passively, in background, captures and archives web pages you visit for later offline viewing, mirroring, and/or indexing.

In other words, this extension implements an in-browser half of your own personal private passive <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> that archives everything you see, including HTTP POST requests and responses (e.g. answer pages of web search engines), as well as most other HTTP-level data (JSON RPC/AJAX/etc).

By default, this extension will save all captured data into browser's local storage, so it can be used standalone, but it implements other archiving methods if you want them.
To view your archived data, however, you will need to install at the very least the accompanying <a href="https://github.com/Own-Data-Privateer/hoardy-web/tool"><b>hoardy-web</b> CLI tool</a> (also <a href="https://oxij.org/software/hoardy-web/tool/">there</a>).

If you do not care about archival, you can also use this extension to log and later inspect HTTP traffic generated by various sleazy websites, even when they generate said web traffic on events that can not normally be inspected with browser's own <b>Network Monitor</b> (e.g. when a page generates HTTP requests when its window closes).

See <a href="https://github.com/Own-Data-Privateer/hoardy-web">project's documentation</a> (also <a href="https://oxij.org/software/hoardy-web/">there</a>) if the above makes little sense, or if you want more docs, or if you want to see in-depth comparisons to <b>archiveweb.page</b> and other similar and related software.

- <b>Hoardy-Web</b> DOES NOT send any of your captured web browsing data anywhere, unless you explicitly configure it to do so.
- <b>Hoardy-Web</b> DOES NOT send any telemetry anywhere.
- Both of the above statements will apply to all future versions of <b>Hoardy-Web</b>.

<b>Hoardy-Web</b> was previously known as "Personal Private Passive Web Archive" aka <b>pWebArc</b>.
