<a href="https://github.com/Own-Data-Privateer/hoardy-web"><b>Hoardy-Web</b></a> (also <a href="https://oxij.org/software/hoardy-web/">there</a>) is a browser extension that tracks, logs, captures, and archives dumps of HTTP requests and responses, passively, in background, as you browse the web.

Mainly, this is useful for archiving your HTTP traffic for later offline viewing and/or indexing.
I.e. this extension implements an in-browser half of your own personal private passive <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> that archives everything you see, including HTTP POST requests and responses (e.g. answer pages of web search engines), as well as most other HTTP-level data (JSON RPC/AJAX/etc).

Basically, you install this, enable it, (optionally) <a href="https://github.com/Own-Data-Privateer/hoardy-web/simple_server">run the archiving server</a> (also <a href="https://oxij.org/software/hoardy-web/simple_server/">there</a>), and forget about it until you need to refer back to something you've seen before.

By default, this extension will save all captured data into browser's local storage (though, it implements other archiving methods if you want them), so it can be used standalone.
However, at the moment, if you want to properly view your collected data you need to install at the very least the accompanying <a href="https://github.com/Own-Data-Privateer/hoardy-web/tool"><b>hoardy</b></a> tool (also <a href="https://oxij.org/software/hoardy-web/tool/">there</a>).

If you do not care about archival, you can also use this extension to log and later inspect HTTP traffic generated by various sleazy websites, even when they generate said web traffic on events that can not normally be inspected with browser's own <b>Network Monitor</b> (e.g. when a page generates HTTP requests when its window closes).

See <a href="https://github.com/Own-Data-Privateer/hoardy-web">project's documentation</a> (also <a href="https://oxij.org/software/hoardy-web/">there</a>) if the above makes little sense, or if you want more docs, or if you want to see in-depth comparisons to <b>archiveweb.page</b> and other similar and related software.

- <b>Hoardy-Web</b> DOES NOT send any of your captured web browsing data anywhere, unless you explicitly configure it to do so.
- <b>Hoardy-Web</b> DOES NOT send any telemetry anywhere.
- Both of the above statements will apply to all future versions of <b>Hoardy-Web</b>.
