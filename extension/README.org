* What?
=pWebArc= (Private Web Archive): a browser extension that passively collects and archives dumps of HTTP requests and responses to your own private archiving server (like [[./dumb_server/][the dumb archiving server]]) as you browse the web.

This is similar to ScrapBook add-ons like [[https://github.com/danny0838/webscrapbook][WebScrapBook]], but following "archive everything now, figure out what to do with it later" philosophy instead of manually archiving things one-by-one.
Also similar to [[https://github.com/webrecorder/archiveweb.page][archiveweb.page]], but with less user interaction.

Basically, you install this, enable it, run the archiving server, and forget about it until you need to refer back to something you've seen before.
* Installation
See [[../README.org#quickstart][Quickstart]].
* What does it do exactly? I have questions.
See [[./page/help.org][extension's "Help" page]] and the FAQ there.
If your question is unanswered by it, then open an Issue on GitHub.
