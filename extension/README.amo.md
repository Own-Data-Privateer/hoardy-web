- `Hoardy-Web` **DOES NOT** send any of your captured web browsing data anywhere, unless you explicitly configure it to do so.
- `Hoardy-Web` **DOES NOT** send any telemetry anywhere.
- Both of the above statements will apply to **all future versions** of `Hoardy-Web`.

For more information see [top-level project's documentation](https://oxij.org/software/hoardy-web/) (also on [GitHub](https://github.com/Own-Data-Privateer/hoardy-web)) and the built-in `Help` page (available via the "Help" button from extension's popup).
The former page also contains in-depth comparisons to `DownloadNet`, `mitmproxy`, `archiveweb.page`, and other similar and related software.
