This is the browser extension of <a href="https://github.com/Own-Data-Privateer/pwebarc">Personal Private Passive Web Archive (pwebarc) project</a> (also available from <a href="https://oxij.org/software/pwebarc/">there</a>), which is a suite of tools that allows you to passively collect and archive HTTP requests and responses as you browse the web and then organize and manage the collected data.

In other words, <b>pwebarc</b> implements your own private <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> that can also archive HTTP POST requests and responses, as well as most other HTTP-level data, which also follows "archive everything now, figure out what to do with it later" philosophy.

At the moment, to start collecting your data you need to install this extension and then run at least the <a href="https://github.com/Own-Data-Privateer/pwebarc/tree/master/dumb_server/">the dumb archiving server</a>, which is a tiny Python script (that uses Python's standard library and nothing else).

None of your data is ever sent anywhere (unless you send generated archives somewhere yourself).

See <a href="https://github.com/Own-Data-Privateer/pwebarc">project documentation</a> (also available from <a href="https://oxij.org/software/pwebarc/">there</a>) for more info.
