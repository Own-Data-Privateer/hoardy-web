<a href="https://github.com/Own-Data-Privateer/pwebarc">pwebarc (Private Web Archive)</a>: a suite of tools to collect, archive, and manage your web browsing data.

Basically, it is your own private <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> that can also archive POST requests, or HTTP-level <a href="https://github.com/danny0838/webscrapbook ">WebScrapBook</a> following "archive everything now, figure out what to do with it later" philosophy.

This extension only collects dumps of HTTP requests and responses as you browse the web. To archive, manage, and browse the archived data you'll need to use <a href="https://github.com/Own-Data-Privateer/pwebarc">accompanying archiving server and related tools</a>.

To quickstart collecting your data, you need to install this extension and run at least the <a href="https://github.com/Own-Data-Privateer/pwebarc/blob/master/dumb_server/pwebarc-dumb-dump-server.py">the dumb archiving server</a>, which is a tiny Python script that uses the Python's standard library and nothing else. Have Python installed? You can run it right now, no need to install anything else.
