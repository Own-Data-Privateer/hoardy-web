# What?

`pwebarc-dumb-dump-server.py`: a very ~~dumb~~ simple archiving server for [pWebArc](../extension/). This thing is less than 200 lines of pure Python that only uses the Python\'s standard library and nothing else. You could be running it already.

# Why?

This was made for easy [Quickstart](../README.md#quickstart). Ideally, you would use something smarter than this (when I publish it), but this will work fine as a starting point.
